# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Move next/previous track swipes to the top edge.
- Add bottom-edge fast-forward/rewind holds with release, cancellation, and disconnect safeguards.
- Update media settings, HUD symbols, and gesture documentation.


All notable changes to SlideSense are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.3] — 2026-11-03

### Added
- **Automatic updates.** SlideSense checks GitHub releases once a day (and on
  demand from Settings → Startup → *Check Now…*), downloads the archive,
  verifies it against the SHA-256 GitHub publishes, swaps the bundle in and
  relaunches. No Sparkle: it refuses to update a bundle whose signature has no
  team identifier, which an ad-hoc build never has.
- Settings → Startup tab: open at login, automatic update checks, version and a
  manual check.
- Settings → Media tab (was "Extras"), so the media controls are easier to find.

### Changed
- Accessibility is only requested while the media strip is enabled — volume and
  brightness never need it.

### Privacy
- The daily update check is the app's only network request: a GET to the public
  GitHub releases API. Nothing about the machine or the user is sent.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-11-03

### Fixed
- The download was called *"damaged"* by Gatekeeper. Without a bundle signature
  the main executable only carries the linker's ad-hoc signature, which fails
  bundle verification ("code has no resources but signature indicates they must
  be present"), and macOS offers no way past it.
- The build script ad-hoc signs the bundle again (`codesign --sign -`), so the
  app is a valid — if unidentified — signature: Gatekeeper now shows the normal
  "Apple could not verify" prompt with an **Open** / *Open Anyway* path.
- Still no certificate, no Apple Developer account, no notarisation, no network.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-11-02

### Changed
- The 1 Hz refresh timer is gone. Volume and mute now arrive as CoreAudio
  property callbacks, and brightness is read when a finger lands and when the
  menu opens. The app no longer wakes up while the pad is untouched.
  (`AppCoordinator` had a timer behind a README that promised "no polling" —
  that was a fair catch, and the code now matches the claim.)

### Planned
- Magic Mouse top-edge support
- Per-edge actions beyond brightness and volume
- Onboarding tour with a live trackpad map

## [0.1.0] — 2026-11-02

The first public release.

### Added
- Volume on the right trackpad edge and brightness on the left, driven by raw
  `MultitouchSupport` contacts rather than an event tap.
- On-screen display: a real Liquid Glass capsule on macOS 26, a frosted HUD on
  macOS 13–15, with a 1 s auto-hide.
- Haptic tick on every level step, with light/medium/strong strength.
- Precise sliding (quarter steps), plus ⇧⌥ fine control while sliding.
- Quick Mute by double-tapping the top-right corner.
- Media strip along the bottom edge: swipe to skip tracks, double-tap to play or
  pause.
- Cursor freeze, bottom-quarter-only mode, required modifier, swap sides, and a
  vertical-axis flip for trackpads that report it backwards.
- Menu bar item with live volume and brightness readouts and a deliberately
  short menu.
- Four-tab settings window: Edges, Feel, Extras, General.
- Open at login via `SMAppService`.
- `--diagnose` and `--dump-touches` diagnostics.

### Notes
- Volume uses CoreAudio, brightness uses the private `DisplayServices` framework
  with a key-event fallback, media commands are posted as system key events.
- Builds are unsigned; downloaded copies need one right-click → Open.
